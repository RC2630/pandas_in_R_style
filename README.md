# `pandas` in R style

This little project aims to showcase how you can emulate the "look and feel" of R code (specifically `tidyverse` code) in Python (`pandas`). It provides functions like `tibble()`, `filter()`, `select()`, and `mutate()` which behave like their `tidyverse` counterparts but act on `pd.DataFrame`s (`pandas`). It also defines the pipe operator `>>` which emulates the behaviour of the pipe operators in R (i.e. `%>%` in `tidyverse` and `|>` in base-R). In the end, you will get to write Python code that looks deceivingly similar to the R (`tidyverse`) code that does the same thing.

Please enjoy my little project, and have a lot of fun with it!
